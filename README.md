# ocular
Universal file viewer with several built-in web protocols. Due to the open-source nature of this project, certain formats may be unavailable until 2027 or beyond. We will try our best to integrate them as soon as possible.
## TODO:
> [!NOTE]
> Items will be marked with a "✓" to indicate that the section is completed. Sections that are not yet possible due to conflicting interests will be marked with a "Ø", and if possible, an expected date that the feature can be included. The current list is not final, and we plan to integrate more codecs in the future.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Developers: Please commit your modules once you have support for all of the media types in the line you are working on.
